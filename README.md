# ‚ú® So you want to run an audit

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our audit collaboration.

Your audit will use two repos: 
- **an _audit_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your audit and for providing information to wardens
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted (shared with you after the audit) 

Ultimately, when we launch the audit, this repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for audit participants. The findings repo will be made public after the audit report is published and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the audit sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Repo setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Add code to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Provide a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 48 business hours prior to audit start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the audit ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Edit this README

Under "SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE" heading below, include the following:

- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation#readme))
  - [ ] When linking, please **provide all links as full absolute links** versus relative links
  - [ ] All information should be provided in markdown format (HTML does not render on Code4rena.com)
- [ ] Under the "Scope" heading, provide the name of each contract and:
  - [ ] source lines of code (excluding blank lines and comments) in each
  - [ ] external contracts called in each
  - [ ] libraries used in each
- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [ ] Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?
- [ ] Describe anything else that adds any special logic that makes your approach unique
- [ ] Identify any areas of specific concern in reviewing the code
- [ ] Review the Gas award pool amount. This can be adjusted up or down, based on your preference - just flag it for Code4rena staff so we can update the pool totals across all comms channels.
- [ ] Ensure that all links and image/file paths in this README use absolute paths, not relative paths. 
- [ ] Optional / nice to have: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] See also: [this checklist in Notion](https://code4rena.notion.site/Key-info-for-Code4rena-sponsors-f60764c4c4574bbf8e7a6dbd72cc49b4#0cafa01e6201462e9f78677a39e09746)
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

# Overview

This contest covers two key pieces:
- v2 of the delegate registry
- v2 of the delegate marketplace

The delegate registry is a standalone singleton database that aggregates onchain programmable access control. Users can link cold wallets to hot wallets, or specify individual token rights to delegate to other wallets. This separation of asset utility from the asset owner is a powerful primitive that enables the delegate marketplace. The delegate marketplace lets users wrap delegation rights into ERC721 tokens that can then be traded or transferred in the same way as any other NFT. The primary usecase here is utility rentals with zero counterparty risk, zero liquidation risk, zero overcollateralization requirements, and an order of magnitude greater capital efficiency.

v1 of the delegate registry has been live across many EVM chains since September 2022. While v1 is not in scope, auditors are encouraged to review its usage patterns at [https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000076a84fef008cdabe6409d2fe638b](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000076a84fef008cdabe6409d2fe638b). A frontend interface across all deployed chains and testnets can be used at [https://delegate.xyz](https://delegate.xyz). The v2 registry is similar to v1, although with expanded support for fungible token amounts, cleaner enumeration methods, multicall transaction batching, gas efficiency improvements, and the introduction of subdelegation rights. Documentation for v1 can be found at [https://docs.delegate.xyz](https://docs.delegate.xyz). 

The delegate marketplace consists of three core contracts: the DelegateToken, the PrincipalToken, and the CreateOfferer. Users will deposit a token, such as a bored ape NFT, into smart contract escrow using the DelegateToken.sol::create() function. They will receive back two ERC721s: a bored ape DelegateToken, and a bored ape PrincipalToken. The holder of the DelegateToken will receive delegate rights for the duration of the escrow. The holder of the PrincipalToken will have the right to redeem the bored ape from escrow at conclusion of the chosen timeframe. Users can choose to transfer or sell neither, one, or both of these. The CreateOfferer is a Seaport Contract Offerer that enables gasless listing of DelegateTokens which have not been created yet. If a buyer fulfills the gasless listing, then the desired token will be atomically escrowed and a DelegateToken created.
